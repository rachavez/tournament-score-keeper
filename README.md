This is a collection of MERN files used to create a game weekend tournament tracker

### What is this repository for? ###

Every few months, a local group of boardgamers get together for a long weekend of playing boardgames. 
Eventually, a tournament cup was given to the person who won the most. This project aims to track points 
earned towards this cup.

### Version ###

    * npm install (to load all node modules - also obvious)

    css-loader, file-loader, style-loader, url-loader, webpack, webpack-dev-server
